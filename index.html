<h1>Knockout mapping demo</h1>
<p>
  This demonstrates that - at least in this trivial example - the two techniques
  for mapping a Knockout ViewModel are functionally equivalent. This uses a
  computed observable property added to the ViewModel to get the "firstName"
  (using String.split) and proves that in the ViewModel that exists and has
  appropriate functionality. It also shows that when un-mapping a ViewModel
  created in that way, we do not get the superfluous extra properties which were
  added by the mapping process; these are dropped from the VM when un-mapping.

  <h2>Example done the old way</h2>
  <p>
    The following example is the result of mapping a plain data-model, enriching
    it using a 2-phase mapping process, then un-mapping it back to plain JS.
  </p>
  <div id="old_way">
    <p class="name_preview"></p>
    <code><pre></pre></code>
  </div>
  <h2>Example done the new way</h2>
  <p>
    The following example is the result of mapping a plain data-model using
    Knockout Mapping plugin's mapping options (single-phase mapping), then
    un-mapping it back to plain JS.
  </p>
  <div id="new_way">
    <p class="name_preview"></p>
    <code><pre></pre></code>
  </div>
